## üß± Challenges I Ran Into

Building Nero-Slime was an adventure with a few bumps:

- **Ethers.js v6**: Switched from `Web3Provider` to `BrowserProvider`, requiring TypeScript tweaks.
- **Window.ethereum**: Extended the `Window` interface to handle MetaMask integration.
- **Animations**: Balanced Framer Motion‚Äôs slime dances with performance.
- **Paymaster Delay**: Postponed NERO Paymaster integration per initial scope.
- **Time Crunch**: Rushed to meet Wave 3 judging criteria (e.g., social login placeholder).

Every hurdle shaped a more resilient dApp!
